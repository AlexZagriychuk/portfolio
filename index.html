                <ul>
                  <li>The portfolio website was created using HTML5, CSS3, and a little bit of JavaScript. Hosted the website on Netlify.</li>
                  <li>Faced with a problem when attempted to display another website (The Bike Shop) as a "subfolder" of the portfolio website ("alexzagriychuk.com/bikeshop/"). Solved it by using the Netlify "_redirects" file with splat option activated ("/bikeshop/*  https://.../:splat 200").</li>
                  <li>The second major problem I went through was that the "subfolder" website, opened by the URL without closing slash "/" ("alexzagriychuk.com/bikeshop"), would break after attempting to navigate to another page ("ABOUT US", "CONTACT"), because without the closing slash, all relative paths would try to get resources in the root page "alexzagriychuk.com/" rather than the current page "alexzagriychuk.com/bikeshop/". I created a workaround solution by adding the "Snippet injection" in the Netlify "Build & deploy" / "Post processing" section. This snippet adds JavaScript code before the end of the "head" section of the "subfolder" website`s index.html file. This code adds the slash at the end of the URL if the "subfolder" website is opened without the trailing slash in the URL.</li>
