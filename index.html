      <div class="about-me__text">
        <p>I started my career in the software industry as a manual tester. After learning some programming skills outside of work and applying them to creating a few small utilities for work and automating some manual work processes, I fell in love with programming. I worked as a manual tester for 2 years, and then I moved to a testing automation role and worked in this role for 4.5 years.</p>
        <p>Now, as a logical continuation of my technical career path, I`m looking to switch from Test Automation / SDET role to a Software Engineering role (preferably as a Full-stack / Front-end / Back-end web developer, but I`m open to considering other options in software engineering).</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>The portfolio website was created using HTML5, CSS3, and a little bit of JavaScript.</li>
                  <li>Faced with a problem when attempted to display another website (The Bike Shop) as a "subfolder" of the portfolio website ("https://alexzagriychuk.com/bikeshop/"). Solved it by using the Netlify "_redirects" file with splat option activated ("/bikeshop/*  https://.../:splat 200")".</li>
                  <li>The second major problem I went through was that the "subfolder" website, opened by the URL without closing slash "/" ("https://alexzagriychuk.com/bikeshop"), would break after attempting to navigate to another page ("ABOUT US", "CONTACT"), because without the closing slash, all relative paths would try to get resources in the root page "alexzagriychuk.com/" rather than the current page "alexzagriychuk.com/bikeshop/". I created a workaround solution by adding the "Snippet injection" in the Netlify "Build & deploy" / "Post processing" section. This snippet adds JavaScript code before the end of the "head" section of the "subfolder" website`s index.html file. This code adds the slash at the end of the URL if the "subfolder" website was opened without the trailing slash in the URL.</li>
