      <h1 class="about-me__title title">About Me</h1>
      <div class="about-me__text">
        <p>I started my career in the software industry as a manual tester. After learning some programming skills outside of work and applying them to creating a few small utilities for work and automating some manual work processes, I fell in love with programming. I worked as a manual tester for 2 years, and then I moved to a testing automation role and worked in this role for 4.5 years.</p>
        <p>Now, as a logical continuation of my technical career path, I`m looking to switch from Test Automation / SDET role to a Software Engineering role (preferably as a Full-stack / Front-end / Back-end web developer, but I`m open to considering other options in software engineering).</p>
